### Project Overview

This project captures the data analysis of AirBnB activity in Seattle using data released as a part of AirBnB Inside Initiative.

As part of this project, I would be investigating the below questions in relation to the data:

- Q1: What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
- Q2: Which are the most popular neigborhoods? Can these neighborhoods be described using the data available?
- Q3: Can we use listing details to predict listing price? If yes, which information is the most significant predictor?

### Required Libraries

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- RegEx
- NLTK
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels


### Data Overview
The following Airbnb activity is included in the Seattle dataset used here:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
