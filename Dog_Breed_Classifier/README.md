# deep_learning_dog_breed_classifier

Udacity Advanced ML nanodegree - Building a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. 

Task: Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Implementation: Convolutional Neural Networks (Python, Keras)
